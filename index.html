  <h1>Termux APT repository for hugo</h1>
  <p>This apt repository contains
    <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> packages for
    <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can access the repo by adding a file ending in .list, e.g. holehan.list, at $PREFIX/etc/apt/sources.list.d containing
    the single line:
    <pre>deb [trusted=yes] https://termux.holehan.org/ termux extras</pre> As the repository is served via https, you may have to first install the apt-transport-https package. The hugo package
    comes with bash-completion support and man pages. So you may want to install those packages as well in Termux:

    <pre>apt install bash-completion man</pre>
